Hello! I'm **Lucas Saurin** from Santa Fe, Argentina. I'm an **advanced student of Computer Engineering**. I enjoy programming and learning about development tools and languages. I aspire to attain a **high level of expertise** in game programming or web development, or perhaps both.\

My favorite language is C++ for desktop applications and JavaScript for web development.\

Projects I'm proud of:
- [SSAO implementation with OpenGL](https://github.com/Lucasa98/Computacion-Grafica-SSAO)
- [Chess Openings Trainer](https://github.com/Lucasa98/Chess-Openings-Trainer)
