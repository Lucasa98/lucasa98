Hello! I'm Lucas Saurin, from Santa Fe, Argentina. Im a Computer Engineerig advance student. I like programing and learning development tools and languages.
I'd like to develop a high level of expertise on game programming or web development (or both!).
My favorite language is C++ (for desktop) and JavaScript (for web).
